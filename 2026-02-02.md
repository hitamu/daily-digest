[Is ChatGPT becoming a commodity? A software engineer's buyer's guide to AI tools](https://strategizeyourcareer.com/p/a-software-engineer-buyers-guide-to-ai-tools)  
- Cảnh quan AI hiện nay rất phức tạp đối với kỹ sư phần mềm, với nhiều công cụ mới ra mắt hàng tuần.
- Một thị trường AI có thể theo hai loại: thị trường chiếm ưu thế và thị trường hàng hóa.
- Trong thị trường chiếm ưu thế, sự khác biệt giữa công cụ tốt nhất và thứ hai lớn, cần luôn sử dụng công cụ tốt nhất.
- Thị trường AI biến động nhanh chóng, công cụ tốt nhất có thể thay đổi chỉ sau sáu tháng.
- Không nên cam kết hợp đồng năm cho một công cụ AI do sự thay đổi nhanh chóng của phần mềm.
- Ưu tiên trải nghiệm người dùng thay vì chỉ số benchmark; một mô hình có thể không luôn đo lường đúng năng lực.
- Cảnh giác với những công cụ chỉ có giao diện đẹp mà không mang lại giá trị sâu sắc.
- Đổi mới cách nhìn nhận chi phí đăng ký AI như một chi phí chuyên nghiệp thay vì giải trí.
- Nên sử dụng thu nhập từ công việc chính hoặc dự án phụ để trang trải chi phí cho các công cụ này.
- Công cụ chuyên dụng nên được coi là chi phí tạm thời cho từng nhu cầu cụ thể.
- Tìm kiếm các cách giảm chi phí thông qua giảm giá và chương trình ưu đãi.
